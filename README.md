The site's colour scheme consists of five key colours; White, off-white, mid-grey, off-black and light-orange. Off-white and off-black where used in each section to ensure there was adequate contrast, with UI components in the accent-colour of light-orange. Mid-grey was used for the english lodge names. White and off-white were alternated between for ajacent sections, to clearly define the sections.
